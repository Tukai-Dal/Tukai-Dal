I love to do research where my helpful findings end up being actively applied in the real world and does not sleep within an academic document. I find it very encouraging when there is a possibility for my contributions to have a positive impact in the world, even if little.

I recently published my Master's thesis on Dalspace after working on two MITACS Canada research terms while attending Dalhousie University.

Currently I am working on preparing an academic paper based on my Master's research work while applying for full time relevant work opportunities. I am also working on an awareness project to prevent current and prospective students in Halifax, Nova Scotia from getting scammed due to the current housing crisis.
